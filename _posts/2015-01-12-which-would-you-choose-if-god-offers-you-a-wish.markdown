我在私人圈子发了一个很有意思的投票，决定重新公开发布。欢迎大家转发。

I introduced an interesting vote in private circles, and I'm willing to republish it.  It's welcome to retweet this vote.

    如果神明答应实现你的愿望，你选择哪一个？

    What would you choose if the god offered you a wish?

    为了保证你选择的愿望恰如我所叙述的，请耐心看看我给出的阐述。

    To guarantee that what you choose is what I mean, please pay a moment to read this explanation.

    需要注意的是，不能通过一个愿望满足多个选项。比如你得到了超能力，那么这个超能力一定不足以支撑你回到过去、投胎到异界，或者得到最好的基因、制造最好的身体。

    In addition, you cannot satisfy multiple options with a single wish.  For example, if you wish to get the super power, it cannot make you back to the past, to born into another world, or to change your genes into the perfect state (or to make a perfect body and transfer your soul into it).

    注意五个选项里面，你个人的记忆都不会被消除。

    Notice that your own memory and thoughts will be kept in all the five options.

<!--more-->

## 选项1：变成七岁的异性。

在这个选项中，你不会回到过去，你的亲友对于你的回忆也不会被消抹，你自己的记忆也会得到保留。神明将会为你捏造一个新的身份，原始身份死亡。你将成为你的父母新收养的小孩子（当然他们不知道你的真实身份）。

你的新身体将具有最优越的基因，无论学什么都能成为顶尖的人物。

1st option: Become a 7-year-old child and change a gender.

In this options, you will not go back to the past, while the memory of your relatives and your friends will not be eliminated.  You memory and your thoughts will also be kept.  The god will provide you a new identity, while the original "you" will be announced death.  You will be an adopted child of your parents (however, they will not be told this truth).

Your new body will be granted the best genes, and you will become the top ones in all professions (whatever you want to be, such as the politicians, the scientists, the economists, and so on).

不过选择这个选项要注意了，你只能得到“人类”范围内最优越的基因而已。姑且“变性”作为代价得到智慧和荣耀，然后希望通过“成为一个伟大的生命科学家，研究基因工程，把自己变回去”的想法还是算了。你确定一个人花 100 年能够让整个人类的生命科学踏出这么大的一步？

However, you should be serious about this option, that you can only get the best genes among human beings.  If you regard the gender transformation as a cost to the perfect intelligence, and you wish to develop the medical or biological techniques with your own mind so as to change your gender back, you may eventually get to the despair because of the sluggish development of human technology, or at least the human industry (the foundation to turn your mind into reality).

此外，为了维护社会稳定，神明禁止你告诉亲友这个愿望。因此你大概只能重新建立人际关系了。

Besides, the god forbids you to tell the truth to your relatives and your fiends.  So you may have to pick up these old relationships once again.

## 选项2：重新回到7岁。

在这个选项中，你将保留记忆并回到你七岁的时候。没有其他任何的金手指，比起选项一，你只能靠你现在的资质，以及你那不怎么靠谱的预言（知道平行宇宙吧？）。

2nd option: Back to your childhood with all your memory and thoughts.

You will become a 7-year-old child again.  No other special offers, so compared with the first option, you can only rely on your "foresight" (which may not be so dependable in that the world would be likely to change after your rebirth).

不过平行宇宙的效应可能并不会很强烈，你就是一个小市民，多你一个蝴蝶其实也不多。

However, you may not be so worry about the butterfly effect, since you are an ordinary person, you may not change the world so dramatically.

## 选项3：投胎到有魔法的异世界。

在这个选项中，你将穿越到一个有魔法的异世界。不能保证这样的世界的政治形态，它可能是封建的、奴隶的，也可能是民主的。你的身体资质和家境将在全世界范围内随机。不过神明给你一个特殊优待，你至少能够搓出一个小火球（哈哈）。

3rd option: Born into another world, where magic powers exist

In this option, you will born into another world.  There exist magic powers.  However, the society is not determined.  It may be a feudal, a slave, or (if you are lucky enough) a democratic one.
You will born in a randomly chosen family in such a world, with a random talent.  The god is benevolent, so he decided to ensure that you will be able to at least emit a fire ball (lol).

其实也不必对这个个选项抱太大恐惧。就算是一个魔法世界，真正能搓出火球，理论上也不会太多。这样的人要么本来就是贵族阶层的（血统好），要么就是有特殊政策可以进入贵族阶层的。这样的例子很多，比如欧洲的骑士阶级，日本的武士阶级，中国的士人阶级。

You may not be so scared about this option.  Be it a world with magic powers, the number of people who can emit a fire ball may not be so large.  These kind of people may be already a member of the noble (likely to born with talent), or there exist special regulations to allow these people to become one of the noble.

## 选项4：投胎到 100 年或以前（但至少是公元后）的历史中

在这个选项中，你将投胎到 100 年或以前（但至少是公元后）的历史中。神明同样给了你一个特殊优待，你可以决定出生地、家境和出生时间中的任意一个。但是请注意，如果你没有选择出生地，将在同年代、同样家境的全球范围内随机。

4th option: Born into the history

In this option, you will born into the history after Jesus is born, and before 1900.  The god allows to you determine one of the three conditions: where you born, when you born, or in what kind of family would you born.  However, you must realize that if you do not choose the place you born, you will be randomly given one in the whole world.

## 选项5：拥有超自然的能力

你将会随机得到一个超能力。它可能只是看穿别人的名字，或者能够隐身，或者制造核爆毁灭一个城市（而你毫发无损）。然而你也可能变成一个僵尸，或者得到无法关闭的你又不愿意得到的被动能力（比如无法关闭的隐身状态）。

这个选项有最大的收益，但也有最大的风险。谨慎选择这个愿望。此外，这个超能力还无法涉及到时间、因果、灵魂的层面。

5th option: Be granted a super power

You will be randomly granted a super power.  It may only be the ability to know other's name, or to hide oneself, or even to make a nuclear explosion in hand.  However, you may also become a zombie, or you may receive an unwilling and uncontrollable ability, such as to be invisible forever.

This option may give you the most, but may also ruin your life.  Choose this with your caution.  Furthermore, this super power cannot reach the level of the time, the causality and the soul.
